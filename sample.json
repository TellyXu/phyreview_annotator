               'auto accident when returning to work, Caused me to break a rib and muscle tear from the seat belt and damage to my lower back L1-L5. I have lost most feeling in my legs and terrible '
               'pain in back and chest. After several visits and no relief on my own I doubled up the pain meds. She had a fit. Again perscribed the same med that did not work in addition to 2 '
               'others. One of them the druggest interferred with my current heart meds and it was suggested to call my surgeon before filling script. The surgeon told me not to fill it and asked '
               'why it was perscribed. I told him and he suggested another dose of the pain med increasing by one pill. When I told this to Dr. Sathi-Welsh she dropped me as a patient and told me to '
               'have the surgeon take over the pain management. I would NEVER recommend this doctor to anyone and have informed my insurance company and the state.</review>\n'
