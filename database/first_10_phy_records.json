I just completed my 4th treatment and I feel GREAT! The injection on my first treatment was something else. She was right on the money with her accuracy. I won't lie; it hurt like h_ll, but only for about 8 seconds and very quickly dissipated. I had almost immediate relief although there was an odd hard to describe mild discomfort for a few hours. I think it's just from a having a needle penetrate that deep, it too goes away rather quickly.  That first injection calmed 90% of my major/main pain. I have not had any reoccurrence of the pain shooting from my back to my toe since. Each subsequent treatment was easier and with much less pain from the previous. My latest shot (4th), there was hardly a tingle which tells me she has relieved me of nearly all my pain. I would stay I am 97% pain free and love the results.  Dr. Abraham is a legit Pain Management doctor, not one of these bull$hit Pill mills places. If you're just looking for drugs and pain killers, like some of the other pi$$ed off reviewers here, don't waste your time she's a REAL doctor not a drug dealer.   - Loving my new pain-free life -   </review>\n<review><meta>#6 - 2016-04-05 15:13:26 - Vitals</meta>Dr. Abraham does a wonderful job. The office is horrible. They are always rude on the phone and in person. Laura, the P.A. does not even do a full assessment on you. She doesnt listen to her patients so her notes on the reports don't match. Very unprofessional and inconsiderate practice. It's sad because I would continue to see the dr if it wasn't for the office and PA. Just not worth it!</review>\n<review><meta>#7 - 2016-12-07 22:52:45 - Vitals</meta>Dr. Abraham Is Awesome! She did an incredible job relieving my of horrible back pain. I highly recommend her. her staff is fantastica as well. they really care.</review>\n<review><meta>#8 - 2018-10-04 14:34:51 - Vitals</meta>Not advised to exact location of injection just lower back. Wasn't expecting it to be way down in the S region. She had a rough time getting the needle in and I can assure you I could feel the pain of it. After the injection when I got on my feet to leave I almost hit the floor because a very sharp pain shot down my right leg. I now have very bad pain in my feet to go along with my lower back pain and hip pain. Now I'm afraid to get any injections because I don't want to be tortured by doctors and have to pay for it and be left in a worse condition.</review>\n<review><meta>#9 - 2019-06-23 00:00:00 - HG</meta>In my opinion, Dr Abraham has to be the worse physician! She refused to look over my medical history and medication list yet criticized me when I couldn't remember the names of some of the medications. She made me cry by yelling at me for not making my own food and exercising.  She was so rude and she ignored my distress. If I could do those things, I wouldn't be there to see her! She also gave me wrong information on when I could return to Physical Therapy.  I should have waited a week but she said to return immediately.  Needless to say, I would not recommend anyone going to her!</review>\n<review><meta>#10 - 2019-10-06 15:40:08 - Vitals</meta>Dr. Abraham has been able to reduce my back pain significantly for the last 4 years. She is caring, kind and very thorough. I highly recommend her.</review>\n<review><meta>#11 - 2021-01-07 00:00:00 - HG</meta>Dr Abraham was great.</review>",

I have referred other patients to her as well.</review>\n<review><meta>#2 - 2013-08-20 01:54:04 - Vitals</meta>Beware. This physician doesn't know her limits. Prescribes narcotics too easily. </review>\n<review><meta>#3 - 2013-09-18 02:10:18 - Vitals</meta>OMG, It started while I was waiting in the lobby to be called back. The receptionist was ranting and raving about a patient who transferred care elsewhere. Major HIPPA violation- I knew her name, insurance & where she was transferring care to from the receptionist's rants. Four people cycled in & out just to check me in. I waited two hours to see the doctor for 5 minutes. There was no exam, which they are billing my insurance large amounts of money for. They made assumptions without an exam & are in such a mindset that everyone is seeking narcotics that I gave up trying to talk after a few minutes & just wanted to cut my losses & get out of there. They talk bad about patients as soon as they leave. Stay far away from this place!  </review>\n<review><meta>#4 - 2014-08-29 05:36:03 - Vitals</meta>I transferred to this doctor when my other one retired. I had a great life, before Dr. Wagle took over my pain management. I could go to my kids activities, walk my dog and swim, as long as I listened to my body and didn't push myself too hard. \n\nAt my first appointment she starts bad mouthing my old doc...\"She doesn't know what she is doing, She's never had pain management training, She has you on a lethal dose of narcotics.\" Well, I wasn't dead yet, and I had a pretty good life because my pain was under control! \n\nIt's now 18 months later and I am bed ridden, because Dr. Wagle has decreased my meds to one-fifth of what I had been taking. She wants to do epidural spinal injections, but I won't let her. I had been told by another specialist that ESIs won't help me, besides the fact that the companies that make ESIs contraindicate its use near neural tissue. In layman's terms, they instruct practitioners NOT to inject them near nerve tissue. Where is she injecting them? Next to the spinal nerves that control everything your body does. This procedure is a big money maker for doctors, they repeat it every few months, and it is quick to do. Eventually, the nerves where it has been injected are surrounded and trapped by scar tissue and the pain becomes unbearable.\n\nThe last few times I've seen her, I have been in tears because I'm in so much pain and I have waited over an hour to see her. No one should suffer with chronic pain in this day and age...it's 2014 for crying out loud!!!\n\nAll I want, is to be able to enjoy life. I am now in misery every single day, because of Dr. Wagle.</review>\n<review><meta>#5 - 2015-02-17 00:43:13 - Vitals</meta>Dr Wagle could careless what you have to say or how you feel.</review>\n<review><meta>#6 - 2015-10-24 02:06:24 - Vitals</meta>I LOVE her, she is awesome, caring and compassionate! This is her true calling, helping people with pain!</review>\n<review><meta>#7 - 2016-06-21 00:00:00 - HG</meta>Dr Wagle is a compassionate Doctor Who truly cared about my pain and wanted to help me get on the road to recovery she has helped me and her staff in every way with finding referrals for surgery and is just a great compassionate person all around .  The doctor and her staff were not judge mental and truly wanted to help me </review>\n<review><meta>#8 - 2016-07-08 15:20:12 - Vitals</meta>I injured my back while on active duty in the Army in 1990.  Over the years I've seen so many doctors I cannot count them.  Dr. Wagle was the FIRST Doctor to help me; explain my problem in detail and treat me, to improve my daily quality of life.  I will never use another Doctor as long as she remains in the QCA.</review>\n<review><meta>#9 - 2016-08-01 00:59:43 - Vitals</meta>Dr Wagle does not care about you or your pain. I had called three times to speak to a nurse because I had an allergic reaction to a procedure that she did. The office never called me back and then I got yelled at by the office because I had yo go to the ER. I had an appointment at 7:30 am and the doctor did not show up until after 10 am.</review>\n<review><meta>#10 - 2016-10-19 09:00:02 - Vitals</meta>\"Medically unnecessary\" treatments.  Thousands of dollars of uninsured costs and I have Cadillac insurance.  Never advised that this would be uninsured.  No customer service.  Zero.  Endless voicemail that is not returned.  The worst medical decision I have ever made  in my life. Do not go here!!!</review>\n<review><meta>#11 - 2017-04-27 00:00:00 - HG</meta>I visited Dr Wagle with my Mother who was trying to get help managing pain for pressure wounds. My mother who has multiple health issues, has severely reduced mobility due to the pain that she is in. While being treated by the health organization that employs this doctor for most of her life, she was treated as a drug seeker, even though she has a history to the contrary. The doctor did not listen or answer our questions about the next steps of her care plan, and refused treatment.</review>\n<review><meta>#12 - 2017-05-10 00:00:00 - HG</meta>I was in substantial pain and she did not listen to my concerns or to anything that i felt was in my own best interest. Her only concern is removing you from any and all pain medication regardless of whether or not you have gotten any relief from any other means. She treats patients like they are there to seek narcotics and makes you feel like you are exaggerating in order to get a hold of pain medication. I had enough of her and withdrew immediately.</review>\n<review><meta>#13 - 2017-06-23 00:00:00 - HG</meta>I was told, despite having regular urine tests, that I was taking my medication inappropriately and my dosage was decreased. I have been a pain patient for 5 years and do not misuse my medication. This caused me to go into withdrawal, without any medical support for the symptoms. </review>\n<review><meta>#14 - 2018-06-06 18:55:59 - Vitals</meta>I have been under Dr. Wagle's care for a couple of years.  I have spinal stenosis and other back degenerative issues which cannot be remedied by surgery.  Dr Wagle has given me pain relief through back injections and conservative pain medications.  She is the most kind and caring doctor I have ever seen.  She keeps me going with this treatment.  I would recommend her to anyone.</review>\n<review><meta>#15 - 2018-10-23 00:00:00 - HG</meta>Dr Wagle is kind, compassionate, and truly cares about getting the best option of care for hurting patients. </review>\n<review><meta>#16 - 2018-11-28 00:35:37 - Vitals</meta>Long ago I had back surgery that didn't go as planned, at one point I was in a very dark place. I turned to the trinity pain clinic and Dr. Wagle. It didn't take her long to find and correct the problem. I owe Dr. Wagle and her wonderful staff a debt of gratitude ever single day I wake up and go to work. Without her treatment I certainly would not be as mobile as I am now. I would and will recommend Dr. Wagle to anyone dealing with back pain. Thank you Dr. wagle for all the wonderful work you have done and continue to do for me</review>\n<review><meta>#17 - 2019-09-23 21:29:24 - Vitals</meta>I just wrote a review 2 days ago that was removed.  2 days ago her rating was in the threes. My review was removed which proves it was correct. She is a liar, unsympathetic, cares not about the pain one is going thru, but how to get that gold star by taking people off pain medications. I left her and the clinic and she continued to try to control my medical use. I am 64 and was on Tylenol 3 for years with Dr. Fullencamp. She wanted to take me down from the amount I was prescribed, for no reason, and I said I would go elsewhere. I have fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, degenerative disc disease, no cartilage in one knee and I never took more medication than I was prescribed. She called my ora Dr. When he prescribed me something stronger when I broke 4 bones in my ankle claiming she should prescribe all my pain meds. When they were arguing about it, she said... Well I don't know anything about broken bones. After I left her practice I had a tooth pulled and the oral surgeon prescribed Tylenol 3. I couldn't get it filled at the pharmacy because she told them only she could prescribe me pain medicine. WE HAD PARTED WAYS A MONTH EARLIER! 3 months later she sent me a scathing letter in the mail lying about things. I couldn't believe it! No longer even my Dr. But she put it in my records so it could follow me to whomever else I went to. She is vindictive, a liar, and not fit to practice medicine.DO NOT GO TO HER! WATCH... THIS REVIEW WILL BE DELETED LIKE MY LAST ONE. IF SO I WILL MAKE ONE PUBLIC THAT COULD GO VIRAL!!!</review>\n<review><meta>#18 - 2019-11-28 00:00:00 - HG</meta>Dr. Wagle is a very compassionate doctor who has performed several different procedures in order to help manage my thoracic and lumbar pain. She truly cares about the whole person- listening to ALL of her patients concerns, and asked me further questions to try to pinpoint the best treatment for my pain. She orders tests as necessary to determine cause of my pain and takes time with me to discuss how effective my treatment has been( am I in less pain?) And she is truly sympathetic to her patients that are suffering in pain. She cares deeply about how my pain is affecting me not only physically, but emotionally as well. She makes every effort to treat my pain as effectively as possible. And I have never been treated like a drug addict as another review stated. I'm treated with care and respect. Dr. Wagle will be my pain doctor until she retires as 2 neurosurgeons have told me thoracic back surgery is not an option in my case.\nThank you Dr. Wagle for 4 years of excellent care!</review>\n<review><meta>#19 - 2020-01-27 00:00:00 - HG</meta>She is so compassionate and truly a very  professional lady!</review>\n<review><meta>#20 - 2020-07-29 00:00:00 - HG</meta>Dr Wagle treats you well. She is so kind, love this Doctor!</review>\n<review><meta>#21 - 2020-12-23 00:00:00 - HG</meta>She is a wonderful doctor. I have been going to her for 4 years. She is compassionate, very informative.

This strong polarization, with severe negative accounts, pulls the assessment down from a simple \"Moderate.\"</reasoning>\n    </initial_judgement>\n\n    <model_evaluations>\n        <model>\n            <name>openai-gpt-4.1</name>\n            <evidence_quality>9</evidence_quality>\n            <reasoning_clarity>9</reasoning_clarity>\n            <trait_understanding>9</trait_understanding>\n            <evidence_specificity>7</evidence_specificity>\n            <conclusion_accuracy>8</conclusion_accuracy>\n            <feedback>The model accurately identifies the polarized nature of the reviews and correctly links this to agreeableness.

While a group of patients experiences her as highly compassionate and caring, another substantial group describes her as unsympathetic, judgmental, and uncooperative. The models providing the most detailed evidence (gemini-2.5-pro-preview, gemini-2.5-flash-preview) strongly supported a \"Low to Moderate\" score, aligning with the initial independent judgment and emphasizing that her agreeable behaviors are not consistently experienced by all patients.</key_insights>\n        <final_score>Low to Moderate</final_score>\n        <final_reasoning>My initial analysis and the evaluations from the more thorough AI models converge on a \"Low to Moderate\" score for agreeableness. The patient reviews are sharply divided: numerous accounts praise Dr. Wagle's compassion and kindness. However, an equally significant number of reviews detail experiences of being dismissed, judged (particularly regarding pain medication), feeling unheard, and perceiving her as unsympathetic or even hostile (e.g., \"vindictive,\" \"could careless\"). The severity and directness of these negative reports, which describe behaviors antithetical to agreeableness, significantly temper the positive accounts, leading to a conclusion that her agreeableness, while evident to some, is perceived as low by many others.</final_reasoning>\n    </final_judgement>\n</judgment>",

The evidence from patient reviews strongly indicates deficiencies in these areas. Recurrent reports of extreme punctuality issues point to disorganization and lack of dependability. Billing for unperformed exams and failing to address financial discrepancies suggest a lack of responsibility and thoroughness in administrative duties. Failure to return urgent patient calls highlights unreliability. The alleged post-care interference described in Review #17, if accurate, represents a severe lapse in professional responsibility. Collectively, these behaviors demonstrate a pattern inconsistent with a conscientious individual.\n        </reasoning>\n    </initial_judgement>\n\n    <model_evaluations>\n        <model>\n            <name>openai-gpt-4.1</name>\n            <evidence_quality>8</evidence_quality>\n            <reasoning_clarity>8</reasoning_clarity>\n            <trait_understanding>7</trait_understanding>\n            <evidence_specificity>7</evidence_specificity>\n            <conclusion_accuracy>6</conclusion_accuracy>\n            <feedback>The model correctly identifies mixed reports and cites relevant evidence for both positive and negative aspects.

Models scoring higher seemed to either give more weight to positive feedback less central to conscientiousness (e.g., perceived clinical skill) or did not fully account for the severity of the reported lapses in organization, dependability, and responsibility. The most impactful evidence points consistently to significant deficiencies in conscientiousness.\n        </key_insights>\n        <final_score>Low</final_score>\n        <final_reasoning>\nMy initial independent analysis concluded a \"Low\" score for conscientiousness due to numerous and severe reports of disorganization (extreme tardiness, long waits), unreliability (unreturned calls, including for urgent issues), irresponsibility (billing for unperformed exams, unresolved financial issues, alleged unethical post-care interference), and lack of thoroughness in some instances. The evaluations from openai-gpt-4o and particularly gemini-gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06 strongly reinforced this judgment. These models excelled in identifying and weighing the most critical evidence directly pertaining to conscientiousness, such as profound punctuality failures and serious administrative/ethical lapses. While some models suggested \"Low to Moderate\" or \"Moderate,\" they appeared to underestimate the impact of these severe negative behaviors. The consistency and gravity of issues like being multiple hours late, billing for services not rendered, and failing to follow up on critical patient concerns provide a robust foundation for a \"Low\" final score.\n        </final_reasoning>\n    </final_judgement>\n</judgment>",

When they were arguing about it...\" and \"3 months later she sent me a scathing letter in the mail lying about things.\"\nEvidence for sociability and general interpersonal warmth is mixed. Some patients report positive communication: \"explain my problem in detail\" (Review #8), \"takes time with me to discuss\" and \"asked me further questions\" (Review #18). However, many others report negative experiences: \"could careless what you have to say\" (Review #5), \"did not listen or answer our questions\" (Review #11), and \"did not listen to my concerns\" (Review #12).\n        </evidence>\n        <reasoning>\nThe score of \"Moderate\" for extraversion is based on the strong evidence for the assertiveness component of the trait. Dr. Wagle's proactive and sometimes confrontational approach in defending her medical opinions or actions (e.g., arguing with another doctor, sending a \"scathing letter\") are clear behavioral indicators of assertiveness. While other common extraverted qualities like consistent positive sociability or high energy are not uniformly reported and are often contradicted by patient experiences of being dismissed or not listened to, the pronounced assertiveness is significant enough to warrant a \"Moderate\" rating. Extraversion is not solely about being friendly; it also encompasses being dominant and forthright.\n        </reasoning>\n    </initial_judgement>\n\n    <model_evaluations>\n        <model>\n            <name>openai-gpt-4.1</name>\n            <evidence_quality>4</evidence_quality>\n            <reasoning_clarity>7</reasoning_clarity>\n            <trait_understanding>6</trait_understanding>\n            <evidence_specificity>2</evidence_specificity>\n            <conclusion_accuracy>2</conclusion_accuracy>\n            <feedback>The model correctly lists facets of extraversion but incorrectly claims there's no evidence for assertiveness.

Only one model (gemini-gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06) accurately identified these cues and aligned with the expert judgment of \"Moderate.\" This suggests a potential limitation in how most models interpret and connect specific, sometimes negatively valenced, interpersonal behaviors (like confrontation) to the assertiveness facet of extraversion.\n        </key_insights>\n        <final_score>Moderate</final_score>\n        <final_reasoning>\nMy initial judgment of \"Moderate\" is maintained. This score is primarily driven by substantial evidence of Dr. Wagle's assertiveness, a core facet of extraversion. Reviews detailing her \"bad mouthing\" another doctor (Review #4), actively arguing with another physician over patient medication, and sending a \"scathing letter\" post-care (Review #17) clearly demonstrate this trait. While other aspects of extraversion, such as consistent positive sociability or overt enthusiasm, are not strongly supported and are often contradicted by patient accounts of her being uncommunicative or dismissive (Reviews #5, #11, #12), the pronounced and impactful assertiveness warrants a \"Moderate\" score.\n\nThe evaluations from the AI models were largely unaligned with this, with four of the five usable models concluding \"No Evidence.\" They generally failed to connect the described confrontational or directive behaviors to the trait of extraversion. However, the gemini-gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06 model provided a high-quality assessment that mirrored my own analysis, specifically citing the evidence for assertiveness and the mixed picture on communication. This single model's accurate and well-reasoned evaluation, despite the majority disagreement, reinforces my confidence in the \"Moderate\" score. The discrepancy highlights the importance of nuanced interpretation of behavioral data, especially for complex traits like extraversion where facets can manifest in varied, and not always positive, ways.\n        </final_reasoning>\n    </final_judgement>\n</judgment>",

For example, Review #4 states, \"She wants to do epidural spinal injections, but I won't let her. I had been told by another specialist that ESIs won't help me,\" and \"she starts bad mouthing my old doc.\" Review #12 notes, \"she did not listen to my concerns or to anything that i felt was in my own best interest. Her only concern is removing you from any and all pain medication.\" Review #17 details instances of her allegedly overriding other specialists and trying to control medication even after the patient left her practice, stating, \"She called my ora Dr. ... claiming she should prescribe all my pain meds... Well I don't know anything about broken bones.\"</evidence>\n        <reasoning>The behavioral evidence strongly indicates a lack of openness to alternative perspectives, patient autonomy, and collaborative decision-making. The pattern of dismissing patient experiences, other doctors' opinions, and adhering rigidly to certain treatment philosophies (e.g., reducing narcotics, promoting specific injections) points to low openness. While some patients had positive experiences, the detailed negative accounts regarding her inflexibility and dismissiveness are more indicative of this specific trait.</reasoning>\n    </initial_judgement>\n\n    <model_evaluations>\n        <model>\n            <name>openai-gpt-4.1</name>\n            <evidence_quality>8</evidence_quality>\n            <reasoning_clarity>8</reasoning_clarity>\n            <trait_understanding>9</trait_understanding>\n            <evidence_specificity>7</evidence_specificity>\n            <conclusion_accuracy>7</conclusion_accuracy>\n            <feedback>The model effectively identified conflicting evidence, citing examples of both potential openness (various procedures) and rigidity (dismissing patient input, bad-mouthing other doctors).

This consistency is significant. My initial judgment was \"Low,\" but the models, particularly the higher-performing ones like gemini-2.5-pro, effectively highlighted that while numerous reviews indicate rigidity, a few (notably Review #18 mentioning \"several different procedures\" and \"listening\") provide some counter-evidence. This suggests that Dr. Wagle may exhibit some openness in terms of treatment modalities but frequently falls short in openness to patient input and alternative perspectives.</key_insights>\n        <final_score>Low to Moderate</final_score>\n        <final_reasoning>My initial analysis leaned heavily on the numerous detailed accounts of Dr. Wagle's rigidity, dismissiveness of patient concerns, and unwillingness to consider alternative opinions or patient preferences (Reviews 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 17). However, all AI models scored the trait as \"Low to Moderate.\" The models' consensus, particularly the strong analyses from gemini-2.5-pro and gemini-2.5-flash, prompted a re-evaluation of positive evidence, such as Review #18 (\"performed several different procedures...listening to ALL of her patients concerns\") and Review #7 (\"finding referrals for surgery\"). This positive evidence, though less frequent, suggests some degree of openness to varied treatment methods. Therefore, \"Low to Moderate\" is a more nuanced final score, acknowledging these instances while still reflecting the predominant theme of limited openness to patient perspectives and collaborative care.</final_reasoning>\n    </final_judgement>\n</judgment>",

I had recently had open heart surgery then an auto accident when returning to work, Caused me to break a rib and muscle tear from the seat belt and damage to my lower back L1-L5. I have lost most feeling in my legs and terrible pain in back and chest. After several visits and no relief on my own I doubled up the pain meds. She had a fit. Again perscribed the same med that did not work in addition to 2 others. One of them the druggest interferred with my current heart meds and it was suggested to call my surgeon before filling script. The surgeon told me not to fill it and asked why it was perscribed. I told him and he suggested another dose of the pain med increasing by one pill. When I told this to Dr. Sathi-Welsh she dropped me as a patient and told me to have the surgeon take over the pain management. I would NEVER recommend this doctor to anyone and have informed my insurance company and the state.</review>\n<review><meta>#1 - 2010-04-02 18:53:44 - Vitals</meta>doesn't manage your paininconsistent/contradictory paperworkappears sedated all the timeunprofessional staff including herdo not see this women</review>\n<review><meta>#2 - 2010-06-30 17:10:12 - Vitals</meta>assembly line medicine knew of drug use but scheduled an appointment and had me wait to see her to tell me that I was not welcome at her office</review>\n<review><meta>#3 - 2010-12-20 20:35:45 - Vitals</meta>ive been in 3 car accidents, have 2 herniations in my neck causing severe migraine and more, 2 heriniations l4 & l5, the pain as u know is terrible, along with TMJ!

Several patients report being \"dropped\" or discharged if they disagreed with her or questioned her (Review #0, #9). Conversely, other patients describe her as \"one of the most caring, knowledgeable and hard working\" (Review #4), \"gentle and kind, patient\" (Review #10), and someone who \"patiently worked with me\" (Review #6) and \"wouldn't leave the room until he understood\" (Review #12).</evidence>\n        <reasoning>The high frequency and intensity of negative reviews detailing behaviors directly contrary to agreeableness (e.g., rudeness, coldness, unwillingness to listen, punitive actions like discharging patients for disagreement) significantly impact the assessment. While there is also substantial positive feedback indicating she can be caring and patient, the negative experiences, particularly the report of diminished compassion over time (Review #5) and the pattern of discharging dissenting patients, suggest that agreeableness is not a consistently displayed trait and is often perceived as low.

While some patients clearly experience Dr. Sathi-Welsch as agreeable, the numerous and detailed accounts of rudeness, coldness, and dismissiveness\u2014especially reports of being discharged for disagreeing\u2014strongly suggest that agreeableness is a significant challenge and not consistently demonstrated.

However, the majority of AI models rated Dr. Sathi-Welsch as \"Moderate to High,\" compelling a reconsideration of the weight given to the exceptionally strong positive evidence of clinical conscientiousness. Specifically, Review #12 (correctly diagnosing a blood disease due to thoroughness and ensuring patient understanding) and other reviews describing her as \"hard working\" (R#4) and \"patiently work[ing]\" (R#6) demonstrate high levels of diligence, thoroughness, and responsibility in critical clinical tasks.

While Dr. Sathi-Welsch shows some openness to adopting new medical technologies and certain alternative treatments, this is significantly counteracted by multiple, strong reports of her being dismissive of patient input, reacting negatively to disagreement, and even discharging patients who question her methods or bring suggestions from other specialists. These behaviors demonstrate a fundamental lack of receptiveness to differing perspectives, which is a core component of openness. The model from Gemini Pro Preview (\"Low to Moderate\") also acknowledged this tension. The severity of being closed off to collaborative input in a medical setting warrants the \"Low\" score.</final_reasoning>\n    </final_judgement>\n</judgment>",

From my very first experience with the doctors everything was explained very well to me. I had a very good understanding of my diagnosis and the procedure and what to expect. When i had the procedure it was essentially painless. Dr. Khimani really explained to me what expect during the procedure and i was able to see what was happening during it. Even after the procedure i felt very safe because the doctor was in constant communication with me and i could reach her at any time with any questions i had. The UltraSonographer along with the rest of the staff was very friendly and helped me with anything that i needed.

I found this office off of the internet and once I read about the Iovera Treatment, I came in and felt very welcomed upon my first impression of the office- it was amazing. Dr. Halland explained very thoroughly about the procedure. I have much more movement in my knees and I am back to being able to play basketball and no longer limited by my activity. I also had some issues with my varicose veins. The docs there were very helpful and I met Dr. Khimani who helped me understand my issue and I then finally got treatment for my varicose veins. Now my legs feel lighter and less swollen. I feel more easy on my feet.

Most Drs. put you off and dont want to help with pain. Dr Forde is very compasionate and kind. I would not be able to go on with out her help. I would reccomend anyone who is in pain to see her.

She is a very busy woman but she always has time for her patients.</review>\n<review><meta>#1 - 2010-05-27 12:28:44 - Vitals</meta>Dr. Forde is a caring, knowledgeable doctor who was able to get to the bottom of my migraines and get them under control for the first time in years. She's warm and welcoming, yet non-nonsense when it comes to your part in your own care, which I liked. I highly recommend her.</review>\n<review><meta>#2 - 2011-05-03 03:23:18 - Vitals</meta>Her appointments are always accurate. No Wait. if any 15min the most.

I am so very satisfied with the help she has given me, which has improved my quality of life significantly.</review>\n<review><meta>#4 - 2012-11-07 17:02:04 - Vitals</meta>If you have pain Dr. forde will help you.  She believes what you say and will work with you to manage your pain.  I have had pain from a spinal disease and she is the first doctor that I feel hears me and will work to relieve my pain.  I do not wantr to take narcotics and she has worked with me to manage my pain with only the osscasional use of narcotics.  I would and have reccommended her to others.</review>\n<review><meta>#5 - 2014-10-21 03:22:27 - Vitals</meta>I was supposed to see someone else for my back pain but pleased after I met Ms. Forde. She was concerned, informative and gave me a thorough examination. She gave me sound advice and was very professional. Have seen other doctors since, but none have been like her. Need to have my follow up with her. </review>\n<review><meta>#6 - 2015-04-03 15:33:32 - Vitals</meta>Excellent, compassionate, great listener, wonderful doctor. </review>\n<review><meta>#7 - 2015-05-14 22:13:48 - Vitals</meta>outstanding doctor! She listens!!!!!\n</review>\n<review><meta>#8 - 2015-11-06 03:05:28 - Vitals</meta>I have been a patient of Dr. Ford's for several years for migraines. Prior to that I tried 6 other neurologists  and pain management specialists.  Dr. Forde is an expert in her field and is always on top of the latest medication.  She also fights for her patients if the insurance company declines a medication. I drive over an hour to see her but wouldn't go anywhere else!</review>\n<review><meta>#9 - 2016-04-23 13:14:45 - Vitals</meta>Dr Grace Forde is an excellent Dr. She takes the time to get to know the whole patient.</review>\n<review><meta>#10 - 2016-04-26 00:00:00 - HG</meta>I know Dr. Forde for many, many years and she has been </review>\n<review><meta>#11 - 2016-05-21 12:08:32 - Vitals</meta>Beneath her tough and professional demeanor is a truly caring and kind medical caregiver.  Dr. Forde is a no-nonsense pain management doctor who truly understands her patients needs and sincerely tries to help patients in chronic pain.  Both offices run smoothly, and I have never waited more than half an hour to see her.  Dr. Forde is extremely experienced and thorough.  She offers me options to help control my pain -- options that are specifically designed for my lifestyle and terrible pain due to a permanent nerve injury. She is upbeat and efficient.  I always look forward to meeting with her, and count on Dr. Forde's advice. </review>\n<review><meta>#12 - 2016-07-27 13:04:07 - Vitals</meta>dr. grace forde. is a doctor who cares about the patient's pain. she is not like those illegal doctors. who  just gives you the medicine for entertainment purposes only.. she has given me pain cream  according to my pain. she has real conversation about your pain. my name is .. i recommend this doctor with a plus 5. </review>\n<review><meta>#13 - 2016-10-21 00:00:00 - HG</meta>I have been seeing Dr Forde for ten years. She honestly is one of the smartest Doctors I have ever come in contact with. She is Kind,compassionate,and up to date with all the latest pain management techniques   She is a true LEADER in her field </review>\n<review><meta>#14 - 2016-12-20 13:34:45 - Vitals</meta>I have been going to dr forde over ten years and she has been the best dr I ever had, especially since my injury in 1993. She listens to you, she explains things when you need it. My daughter unfortunately needed to go to her for pain and she is only 14. She had MRI's done and dr forde draw the spine to show exactly how the tests results were reading. She is one of a kind and we love her! Oh and once I was hospitalized with unrelated problems and she came to see me! Don't know many dr's that will do that. \ud83d\udc96</review>\n<review><meta>#15 - 2017-02-15 00:00:00 - HG</meta>Love Dr Forde! She provides exceptional care and personalized treatment options for those on pain and requiring a dedicated provider. When experience, understandings and compassion are key, Dr Forde is see the one to see. She always thinks out of the box and remembers patients' specific needs. I truly value her attention and honesty. The new office in Lake Success is a breath of fresh air, too. Calm, quiet and serene. The parking is limited so leave xtra time for that. </review>\n<review><meta>#16 - 2017-04-26 00:00:00 - HG</meta>Dr Forde is an excellent pain management Doctor very knowledgeable about all the latest medicines. Highly recommend her.</review>\n<review><meta>#17 - 2017-07-31 03:09:35 - Vitals</meta>Dr Forde is a brilliant Neurologist with the greatest bedside manner I've ever experienced in a specialist. I came to her barely physically functional. Between her vast knowledge and genuine compassion, she worked with me to find a treatment plan that affords me a quality of life I never thought possible considering the severity of my disease. I went through 3 years and over 2 dozen doctors who wouldn't even take an appointment with me because of how damaged I was. From my 1st evaluation until my most recent appointments, Dr Forde has made me feel informed to make smart decisions about our treatment plan, comfortable in discussing any questions, concerns, or changes that arise, and most importantly I have never felt judged by my appearance like literally every other person who doesn't understand that not all disabilities are visually apparent. She truly is excellent.</review>\n<review><meta>#18 - 2017-09-29 09:24:09 - Vitals</meta>I  was treated by dr forde for migraine headaches, having been to her office exactly 2 times. The first visit was for a consultation. At the second visit, she knew nothing about me, clearly didn't bother to read my chart. Wow! I felt as if it was the first visit all over again. When she speaks to you, she. half listens to what you say. I waited over an hour to seen. That's just ridiculous. Also keep in mind  the frequency of which she changes her office location, all over nassau county, unable to establish in one location. There are other doctors who are given outstanding reviews and really care about their patients...dr forde is definetly not one of them</review>\n<review><meta>#19 - 2017-11-07 00:00:00 - HG</meta>Dr Forde has been my doctor since I was 18 years old at which time I was diagnosed with rsd which is a life time debilitating diagnosis. She has helped me learn to deal with the pain and learn how to continue function my everyday life! She's always available and accommodating when I need an injection! I HIGHLY recommend her! Total life saver </review>\n<review><meta>#20 - 2018-01-29 17:34:02 - Vitals</meta>I've been seeing Dr. Forde for close to 10 years now. She is a gem.</review>\n<review><meta>#21 - 2018-06-07 21:20:17 - Vitals</meta>We were late for my husband's first appointment due to an error on my part thinking the scheduled time was later than it was.  Dr. Forde would not even consider seeing him at that time, although he has Parkinson's Disease and is in a wheelchair.  No compassion.</review>\n<review><meta>#22 - 2018-07-21 01:36:13 - Vitals</meta>I have been seeing Dr. Forde for in excess of 20 years and she is a very caring and extremely competent professional who made my chronic pain resulting from a botched surgery manageable. I cannot say enough positive things about Grace who I consider a friend.</review>\n<review><meta>#23 - 2018-07-26 00:00:00 - HG</meta>Dr Forde is very professional. I also admire her ability to explain things concisely and directly. \nI admire her philanthropic attitudes and behaviors too!!!\nI find Dr Forde to be unique and very refreshing!!!</review>\n<review><meta>#24 - 2018-09-15 07:16:27 - Vitals</meta>Dr. Forde at first seemed highly knowledgeable but has been  unwilling to assist me in my journey to find adequate pain relief.  Having seen her three times. this last time I was turned away when it was noted that I could not receive the treatment she suggested due to allergies.   I am extremely saddened given this new climate of anti opioids, that the one doctor who  could have helped me with alternatives, has shunned me.</review>\n<review><meta>#25 - 2018-10-15 00:00:00 - HG</meta>I  never had such a bad experience with a doctor in my life. I saw her for severe pain and not only did she not have any compassion for me but she was abusive towards me.  She spent under 5 minutes with me and did not help me or treat me at all. She should not be a doctor as she does not care about her patients, let alone be a pain management doctor.</review>\n<review><meta>#26 - 2018-10-15 17:48:02 - Vitals</meta>Not only was Dr. Forde not compassionate towards me  a patient in severe chronic pain, but she was abusive. She also did not help me or even offer me any treatment. She should have her license taken away!</review>\n<review><meta>#27 - 2018-11-08 23:15:06 - Vitals</meta>First visit I thought she was cold but professional. 2nd visit-quite friendly, asked about my family and shared many things about herself. very knowledgeable  about my problem and quite helpful</review>\n<review><meta>#28 - 2019-01-15 13:30:36 - Vitals</meta>And I'll never forget how mean-spirited and dismissive she was to me.  This visit scarred me for life.  Maybe she was just having a bad day, but I doubt it seeing as how at least one other person called her abusive.  That's exactly how I would have described her, too.  I don't understand why she wanted to be a doctor if she's not interested in listening or helping in any way.  She wasn't just standoffish, she was actively rude and nasty to somebody who was scared and in a great deal of pain.  When I nicely mentioned that I was thinking of getting a particular test, she yelled at me, GO DO THAT THEN!  Huh?  What kind of response is that?  Such venom.  She saw me for a minute or two, yelled at me repeatedly, and then just abruptly left.  I was so bewildered and hurt.  Can't believe I had to pay for such a horrible visit.</review>\n<review><meta>#29 - 2019-02-02 00:00:00 - HG</meta>Poor management all around. Don't waste your time . Find someone else. Anyone else. Never even saw the provider because the office staff was so horrendous.</review>\n<review><meta>#30 - 2019-08-14 15:07:02 - Vitals</meta>Very patient with her patients by taking the time to listen.</review>\n<review><meta>#31 - 2019-08-22 12:44:46 - Vitals</meta>Went to Dr. Forde yesterday she was rude, dismissive, nasty, and uncompassionate. Had the nerve to tell me that my orthopedist is an \"idiot\" in not so many words (she should be half the doctor he is) he's the best in New York. I guess any idiot can be a doctor obviously it doesn't take brains. She should have her license yanked.</review>\n<review><meta>#32 - 2019-09-30 00:00:00 - HG</meta>Dr Forde is an excellent neurologist, keeps up to date on latest research - as a nurse, I will only trust a physician who takes professional pride in providing the best treatment available. I have referred family with utmost confidence</review>\n<review><meta>#33 - 2021-01-08 00:00:00 - HG</meta>Dr. Forde is very thorough, listens to all your answers to her questions and gives a decisive reply as to what to do to handle your pain. Professional in every way!</review>\n<review><meta>#34 - 2021-07-29 00:00:00 - HG</meta>Sought last resort guidance and help with spouse's long-standing post-stroke pain. Dr. Forde could not have been a better listener, more exploratory, more helpful with actual meds to try. Office staff were very welcoming.  </review>",

Numerous reviews use terms like \"very sweet and caring,\" \"compassionate and kind,\" \"great listener,\" and describe her as someone who \"believes what you say\" and \"fights for her patients\" (e.g., Reviews #0, #1, #6, #8, #13, #14, #17). These indicate a capacity for high agreeableness. Conversely, a significant cluster of reviews, particularly from 2017-2019, describe extremely negative interactions, using terms such as \"rude,\" \"dismissive,\" \"nasty,\" \"uncompassionate,\" \"mean-spirited,\" and even \"abusive\" (e.g., Reviews #18, #21, #25, #26, #28, #31).</evidence>\n        <reasoning>The presence of both highly positive and severely negative accounts of Dr. Forde's interpersonal style suggests a high variability in her agreeableness. While many patients experience her as warm, empathetic, and cooperative, others perceive her as cold, uncooperative, or hostile.

The AI model evaluations largely corroborated this view. Five out of the six models also assigned a \"Moderate\" score, with most noting \"Low\" consistency. The reasoning from top-performing models like Gemini 1.5 Pro and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which highlighted the \"polarized\" feedback and \"stark inconsistency,\" strongly aligned with my assessment. Although one model suggested \"Moderate to High,\" the gravity of the negative reports (such as \"abusive\" and \"mean-spirited\") significantly tempers the overall assessment of agreeableness. Therefore, a \"Moderate\" score best reflects this high variance in Dr. Forde's interpersonal behaviors.</final_reasoning>\n    </final_judgement>\n</judgment>\n```",

Patients describe her as \"exploratory\" (Review #34) and willing to use \"a combination of diet, nutrition, physical therapy, and medication\" (Review #3). One patient explicitly states she \"thinks out of the box\" (Review #15). However, this is contrasted by reports of unwillingness to explore alternatives when her initial suggestion was not viable (Review #24: \"unwilling to assist me... with alternatives\") and reacting negatively to patient input (Review #28: \"yelled at me\" for suggesting a test).</evidence>\n        <reasoning>The positive evidence strongly supports openness in terms of adopting new medical knowledge and diverse treatment strategies. However, the negative instances indicate that this openness may not consistently extend to collaborative decision-making with patients or adapting when her primary approach is challenged or unsuitable. This duality suggests a level of openness that is generally high in her professional learning and application of medical techniques but can be limited in specific interpersonal or problem-solving contexts with patients.</reasoning>\n    </initial_judgement>\n\n    <model_evaluations>\n        <model>\n            <name>openai-gpt-4.1</name>\n            <evidence_quality>9</evidence_quality>\n            <reasoning_clarity>9</reasoning_clarity>\n            <trait_understanding>9</trait_understanding>\n            <evidence_specificity>8</evidence_specificity>\n            <conclusion_accuracy>9</conclusion_accuracy>\n            <feedback>This model provides a well-balanced assessment.

However, this is counterbalanced by patient accounts of rigidity or unwillingness to explore alternatives suggested by or necessary for the patient (e.g., due to allergies, or patient-initiated ideas). This duality supports a \"Moderate to High\" score, reflecting openness in her professional development and treatment diversity, but with some limitations in collaborative or adaptive patient-centered scenarios.</final_reasoning>\n    </final_judgement>\n</judgment>",

The models arguing for \"Moderate\" generally provided stronger reasoning regarding the limited scope of the evidence and the absence of other indicators of openness (e.g., creativity, intellectual curiosity). My initial assessment was \"Low to Moderate\", and the models, particularly the Gemini series, helped refine this to \"Moderate\" by reinforcing the significance of the existing evidence while appropriately contextualizing its limitations.</key_insights>\n        <final_score>Moderate</final_score>\n        <final_reasoning>The final score of \"Moderate\" is based on the single, clear piece of evidence from Review #0 where Dr. Stoica is described as \"open to what I wanted.\" This demonstrates openness in terms of being receptive to patient preferences. However, this is the only review providing direct evidence for this trait, and other dimensions of openness (like intellectual curiosity, creativity, or seeking novel experiences) are not apparent in the provided data. The Gemini models' consistent \"Moderate\" rating, supported by reasoning that emphasized the limited scope of evidence, was influential in shifting my initial \"Low to Moderate\" assessment slightly upwards while still acknowledging the narrow evidential base.</final_reasoning>\n    </final_judgement>\n</judgment>",

It didn't seem to matter whether I was able to take certain medications or not she would prescribe whatever she wanted. No bedside manner at all. Rude and doesn't care about your well being. Claims she discusses things with you in your records but when you get a copy of  your records there are things in their she never mentioned! </review>\n<review><meta>#1 - 2016-01-27 00:00:00 - HG</meta>She was very good about getting me the medications that I needed and helping me that way,  But two different times she or her assistant failed to submit paperwork to Matrix Absence Management being I am taking intermittent..  The first time I let go trying to understand it was the holiday season.  The second time really pissed me off, because it actually stopped my claim and I had to restart it.  She really needs to pay more attention to her patients paperwork and make sure it gets submitted!!</review>\n<review><meta>#2 - 2016-03-01 00:00:00 - HG</meta>Called to make an appointment with referral from my PC.

She is very good but apts were short.  I feel we have had time to discuss the important things, but not indepth or throw around ideas. (Although the other docs had tried so much maybe she simply had nothing else to add beyond what she did -which worked).  I didnt feel a strong patient-doc connection w/ her due to the in-&-out.  She helped though, is very sweet & I'd recommend</review>\n<review><meta>#4 - 2017-03-27 00:00:00 - HG</meta>the drugs she gave sent me to the ER twice </review>\n<review><meta>#5 - 2017-03-27 17:47:36 - Vitals</meta>Her attitude is \"don't know, don't care, don't have that problem\" and the drugs she gave sent me to the emergency room twice.

For the past 7 years I feel like I've been passed between doctor to doctor telling me I'm okay my back looks fine.  then with injections that I have received on the 16th; Feels like my back is almost back to 100%. I'm so grateful and blessed to have an awesome doctor like dr Byrne. Dr Byrne thank you for not just treating me like normal patient. Actually felt like you cared and then when you squeezed me in when I mixed up the times for my injections. I have also never had a doctor explain things so clearly for me. You found the problem and then you went and fixed it all within a 3 weeks time.

I was content with the prescriptions that kept my pain managed. I was surprised that the injections worked. Dr Byrne has tried many different things to help my pain and I appreciate that.

Instead of waiting for 3 or 4 weeks.</review>\n<review><meta>#47 - 2020-01-12 00:00:00 - HG</meta>She came in with a preconceived notion about me. It seems that young people cannot have pain issues. It was very disheartening. I was sent on a referral. Had done my homework, and had tons of doctors write notes for me. She read none before the visit. I had to push her to even read the files, in my file. Overall, she pushed for more imaging, that I already had done. Which costs me more money. So utterly frustrating.</review>\n<review><meta>#48 - 2020-01-16 00:00:00 - HG</meta>One of the worst doctor appointments I have had.

These are frequently highlighted. However, the presence of several highly critical reviews detailing directly opposite behaviors (rudeness, dismissiveness, lack of care) cannot be ignored. These negative accounts, though fewer, are strong and specific, suggesting that her agreeableness is not universally experienced or consistently displayed. Therefore, while there's substantial evidence for agreeableness, the negative feedback prevents a \"High\" rating, leading to a \"Moderate to High\" assessment.</reasoning>\n    </initial_judgement>\n\n    <model_evaluations>\n        <model>\n            <name>openai-gpt-4.1</name>\n            <evidence_quality>9</evidence_quality>\n            <reasoning_clarity>8</reasoning_clarity>\n            <trait_understanding>9</trait_understanding>\n            <evidence_specificity>8</evidence_specificity>\n            <conclusion_accuracy>9</conclusion_accuracy>\n            <feedback>The model accurately identified the predominant positive sentiment regarding Dr. Byrne's agreeableness while also acknowledging the contrasting negative reviews.

However, the negative reviews detailing failures in administrative tasks like submitting paperwork (#1), sending prescriptions (#2), or inadequate preparation (#47, #93) are significant and cannot be overlooked.

These suggest outgoing and socially engaging behaviors. However, contrasting reviews mention \"No bedside manner at all.

However, the presence of strong negative feedback regarding her interpersonal style (rudeness, condescension) and some experiences of brief, impersonal interactions prevent a higher rating. This suggests that while often extraverted, this trait is not consistently perceived positively or may be counteracted by other behaviors, leading to a \"Moderate\" assessment.</reasoning>\n    </initial_judgement>\n\n    <model_evaluations>\n        <model>\n            <name>openai-gpt-4.1</name>\n            <evidence_quality>8</evidence_quality>\n            <reasoning_clarity>8</reasoning_clarity>\n            <trait_understanding>9</trait_understanding>\n            <evidence_specificity>7</evidence_specificity>\n            <conclusion_accuracy>8</conclusion_accuracy>\n            <feedback>The model provides a balanced assessment, citing both positive descriptors of sociability and contrasting points about rushed appointments.

However, this is counterbalanced by a subset of reviews that portray her as \"rude,\" \"condescending,\" or providing \"in-and-out\" service, suggesting her extraverted qualities are not universally or consistently demonstrated or perceived positively.

These behaviors can be manifestations of neurotic traits such as irritability or poor emotional regulation under stress. While these negative accounts are less frequent, their severity and recurrence across multiple reviews suggest they are not isolated incidents.

The model aligning with \"Low to Moderate\" (gemini-2.0-flash) provided a balanced interpretation, acknowledging that infrequent but notable negative behaviors (rudeness, dismissiveness) could indicate occasional emotional reactivity or instability, preventing a purely \"Low\" score. The negative reviews, though fewer, are specific and impactful enough to suggest that neurotic traits are not entirely absent.\n        </key_insights>\n        <final_score>Low to Moderate</final_score>\n        <final_reasoning>My initial judgment of \"Low to Moderate\" was largely confirmed after reviewing the AI model assessments. While the majority of models leaned towards a \"Low\" score, their reasoning often minimized the impact of several pointed negative reviews. These reviews describe behaviors such as rudeness, condescension, and a dismissive attitude (e.g., #0, #5, #21, #47, #93), which are consistent with manifestations of neuroticism like irritability or poor stress management. Although outnumbered by overwhelmingly positive feedback praising Dr. Byrne's calmness, professionalism, and ability to reassure patients (indicative of low neuroticism), these negative accounts are too specific and recurrent to be entirely dismissed. Therefore, \"Low to Moderate\" best reflects a generally stable emotional disposition with documented instances of behaviors that align with neurotic tendencies.\n        </final_reasoning>\n    </final_judgement>\n</judgment>",

Negative evidence includes reports such as \"It didn't seem to matter whether I was able to take certain medications or not she would prescribe whatever she wanted\" (Review #0), appointments being \"short... not indepth or throw around ideas\" (Review #3), and a patient feeling Dr. Byrne \"came in with a preconceived notion about me... She read none before the visit\" (Review #47).</evidence>\n        <reasoning>Dr. Byrne demonstrates openness by being willing to utilize various medical treatments and approaches, particularly in managing complex pain conditions where other doctors may have failed or been hesitant. This suggests an openness to new or diverse medical interventions. However, this is counterbalanced by several patient accounts suggesting a lack of openness to patient input, collaborative discussion of ideas, or a willingness to deviate from her own initial assessments or preferred methods.

All six AI models corroborated this \"Moderate\" assessment. The models, particularly the higher-rated ones, effectively highlighted that Dr. Byrne's openness is evident in her willingness to explore different medical interventions but is less apparent in her receptiveness to patient perspectives or collaborative ideation. This strong consensus between expert review and diverse AI models solidifies the \"Moderate\" rating.</final_reasoning>\n    </final_judgement>\n</judgment>",

This indicates good interpersonal skills and a willingness to engage socially in her professional capacity.

She appears comfortable and skilled in patient interactions. The negative review (Review #4) provides a counterpoint, indicating that this sociability might not be universally applied or could be overridden by directness or task-focus in other situations.

This indicates a capacity for social engagement.

These traits, particularly her ability to reassure patients and families during high-stress situations like open-heart surgery, suggest emotional stability. One review (Review #4) describes an abrupt interaction over the phone (\"if I didn't need surgery not to contact her that I'm not the doctor for her\"), which could be interpreted as irritability.</evidence>\n        <reasoning>Dr. Grigore predominantly exhibits behaviors indicative of low neuroticism, such as calmness, professionalism, and the ability to reassure others in stressful medical contexts. These are counter-indicators for neuroticism. While a single review reports an abrupt interaction, this isolated incident, especially in a non-clinical context (a phone call about insurance/scope of practice), is insufficient to establish a pattern of neurotic behavior (e.g., anxiety, persistent irritability, emotional instability) when weighed against multiple positive accounts of her demeanor during direct patient care.</reasoning>\n    </initial_judgement>\n\n    <model_evaluations>\n        <model>\n            <name>openai-gpt-4.1</name>\n            <evidence_quality>7</evidence_quality>\n            <reasoning_clarity>8</reasoning_clarity>\n            <trait_understanding>9</trait_understanding>\n            <evidence_specificity>6</evidence_specificity>\n            <conclusion_accuracy>8</conclusion_accuracy>\n            <feedback>The model correctly identifies key indicators of low neuroticism like professionalism and reassurance.

Less effective models tended to ignore this outlier. There is a high level of agreement among the better-performing models that the doctor exhibits low neuroticism.

This suggests strong emotional stability. While one review indicated a potentially irritable interaction, this isolated event does not outweigh the substantial evidence of her calm and supportive demeanor. The most thorough AI model evaluations align with this conclusion, acknowledging the outlier but giving more weight to the consistent positive indicators.</final_reasoning>\n    </final_judgement>\n</judgment>\n```",

This suggests openness in communication within that specific context. However, Review #4 describes a dismissive interaction (\"if I didn't need surgery not to contact her that I'm not the doctor for her\") when a potential patient called with an inquiry, suggesting a lack of openness to engagement outside her direct surgical scope.</evidence>\n        <reasoning>Dr. Grigore shows openness when communicating with her existing surgical patients about their procedures, providing detailed information. This is a positive indicator. However, the interaction described in Review #4 points to a significant lack of flexibility and receptiveness to inquiries that don't perfectly align with her specialty, indicating a more closed approach in a broader context. The overall assessment balances these conflicting pieces of evidence.</reasoning>\n    </initial_judgement>\n\n    <model_evaluations>\n        <model>\n            <name>openai-gpt-4.1</name>\n            <evidence_quality>8</evidence_quality>\n            <reasoning_clarity>8</reasoning_clarity>\n            <trait_understanding>7</trait_understanding>\n            <evidence_specificity>7</evidence_specificity>\n            <conclusion_accuracy>7</conclusion_accuracy>\n            <feedback>The model effectively balanced positive evidence of communicative openness with the negative review indicating limitations in flexibility.

The OpenAI models leaned \"Moderate\" and Gemini Pro leaned \"Low,\" all acknowledging the conflicting evidence. The \"Low to Moderate\" score best captures this duality: openness in direct patient communication versus a lack of flexibility with external inquiries. Models using overly narrow definitions of Openness (Gemini Flash) were less helpful, while the model ignoring key negative evidence (Claude Sonnet) was less accurate.</key_insights>\n        <final_score>Low to Moderate</final_score>\n        <final_reasoning>The final score of \"Low to Moderate\" reflects a nuanced view of Dr. Grigore's openness. She demonstrates commendable openness in communicating detailed procedural information and responding to questions from her surgical patients (Reviews #0, #1, #2), aligning with the \"Moderate\" aspect. However, the interaction in Review #4, where a potential patient's inquiry was curtly dismissed, indicates a significant lack of openness, flexibility, and receptiveness outside her immediate, narrowly defined surgical role. This points to the \"Low\" aspect of the trait. The model evaluations from GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, and Gemini Pro, which grappled with this conflicting evidence, helped confirm that the trait expression is context-dependent and not uniformly high or low.</final_reasoning>\n    </final_judgement>\n</judgment>",
